🚀 Hogwarts, Here He Comes! 🐍🎬

I just finished an Invisibility Cloak video project using Python and OpenCV.

🧙‍♂️✨ The Challenge

The blanket was double-sided, so the striped side on the back kept peeking through. I might refine the color mask when I get more free time. 🎨🌀

Getting a wiggly 8-year-old to stay still with a blanket over his head? 😅 Not as easy as it sounds! Patience and persistence paid off. 👶💪

🎥💻 The Result

A smooth video that demonstrates real-time video processing and color detection—perfect for anyone exploring computer vision, Python projects, or creative coding for fun.



💡 Lessons Learned

How lighting and fabric patterns affect color masking 🌈

The importance of preprocessing & mask refinement in OpenCV 🛠️

Keeping coding playful while tackling real-world unpredictability 👾

🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python)

NumPy

FFmpeg (for optional video encoding/music)

You can install dependencies with:

pip install opencv-python numpy

🚀 Usage

Place your video (.MOV) and background image (.JPG) in the project folder.

Run the script:

python invisibility_cloak.py


The final video will be saved as invisibility_cloak_final_h264.mp4.

Optional: Add music using FFmpeg by modifying the script with your .mp3 file.
